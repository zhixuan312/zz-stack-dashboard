/**
 * Normalize markdown for the `ProseBlock` renderer — CRLF → LF and trim only.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT escape `<`/`>`. `ProseBlock` renders through react-markdown
 * with remark-gfm and NO rehype-raw, so raw HTML is already rendered as inert text —
 * `<script>` never becomes a DOM node. A blanket `<`→`&lt;` / `>`→`&gt;` escape corrupts
 * legitimate content: inside a code span CommonMark does not decode entities, so
 * `` `<projectId>` `` and `->` render as the literal `&lt;projectId&gt;` / `-&gt;`.
 * Normalization is all that belongs here; safety is the renderer's job.
